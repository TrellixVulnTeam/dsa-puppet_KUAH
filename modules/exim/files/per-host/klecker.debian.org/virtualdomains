#  virtualdomains - This is a list of all virtual domains. A virtual domain
#           is much like a local domain, execpt that the delivery location
#           and allowed set of users is controlled by a virtual domain
#           alias file and not /etc/passwd. Wildcards are permitted

# This file lists the virtual domains that this host should handle. The
# format is 
#  host: user=user group=group directory=dir
# Host may be a wildcard.
# User/Group are the symbolic names of the uid/gid to operate under when
#    performing deliveries for this name. These should not be root!
# Directory is the directory to look in for data files. The directory and
#    files may be group writable. The first file to lookup is DIR/aliases
#    which is a traditional exim/sendmail alias file. You can specify
#    users, patterns, pipes and filenames. If that fails then 
#    .forward-foo is tried, should that fail then .forward-default is tried.
#    Finally the email will bounce.
